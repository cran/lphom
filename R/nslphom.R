#' @param votes_election1 data.frame (or matrix) of order IxJ1 with the votes gained by 
#'                        (or the counts corresponding to) the J1 political options competing

#'                        political options competing (available) on election 2 (or destination) 
#'                        in the I (territorial) units considered. In general, the column marginals 
#'                        of the I tables corresponding to the units.
#'
#' @param new_and_exit_voters A character string indicating the level of information available
#'                            in `votes_election1` and `votes_election2` regarding new entries 
#'                            and exits of the election censuses between the two elections. 
#'                            This argument allows, in addition to the options discussed in Pavia 
#'                            (2023), three more options. This argument admits eleven different values: 
#'                            `raw`, `regular`, `ordinary`, `enriched`, `adjust1`, `adjust2`, 
#'                            `simultaneous`, `semifull`, `full`, `fullreverse` and `gold`. 
#'                            Default, `raw`.
#'                            
#' @param apriori data.frame (or matrix) of order J0xK0 with an initial estimate of the 
#'                (row-standarized) global voter transition proportions/fractions, pjk0, between
#'                the first J0 (election) options of election 1 and the first K0 (election) options
#'                of election 2. This matrix can contain some missing values. When no a priori
#'                information is available `apriori` is a null object. Default, `NULL`.  
#'                        
#' @param lambda A number between 0 and 1, informing the relative weight the user assigns to the 
#'               `apriori` information. Setting `lambda = 0` is equivalent to not having a priori
#'               information (i.e., `apriori = NULL`). Default, `0.5`.
#' 
#' @param uniform A `TRUE/FALSE` value that informs whether census exits impact all the electoral options
#'                in a (relatively) similar fashion in all iterations, including iteration 0 and 
#'                when deriving units tables. If `uniform = TRUE` typically at least one of the equations  
#'                among equations (6) to (11) of Pavia (2023) is included in the underlying model.
#'                This parameter has no effect in `simultaneous` scenarios. It also has not impact 
#'                in `raw` and `regular` scenarios when no net exits are estimated by the function
#'                from the provided information. Default, `TRUE`.
#'
#' @param iter.max Maximum number of iterations to be performed. The process ends when either the
#'                 number of iterations reaches iter.max or when the maximum variation between two consecutive
#'                 estimates of the probability transfer matrix is less than `tol`. By default, `10`.
#'
#' @param min.first A `TRUE/FALSE` value. If `min.first = FALSE`, the matrix associated with the 
#'                  minimum `HETe` after performing `iter.max` iterations is taken as solution.
#'                  If `min.first = TRUE`, the associated matrix to the instant in which the first decrease 
#'                  of `HETe` occurs is taken as solution. The process stops at that moment. 
#'                  In this last scenario (when `min.first = TRUE`), `burnin = 0` is forced and `iter.max` 
#'                  is at least `100`. Default, `FALSE`.
#'
#' @param structural_zeros Default `NULL`. A list of vectors of length two, indicating the election options
#'                         for which no transfer of votes are allowed between election 1 and election 2.
#'                         For instance, when new_and_exit_voters is set to `"semifull"`,
#'                         lphom implicitly states `structural_zeros = list(c(J1, K2))`.
#'
#' @param integers A `TRUE/FALSE` value that indicates whether the problem is solved in integer values
#'                 in both iterations, including iteration zero (lphom) and the rest of iterations, 
#'                 when deriving unit tables solutions. If `integers = TRUE`, the LP matrices are 
#'                 approximated to the closest integer solution solving 
#'                 the corresponding Integer Linear Program. Default, `FALSE`.
#'
#' @param distance.local A string argument that indicates whether the second step of the lphom_local algorithm
#'                       should be performed to solve potential indeterminacies of local solutions.
#'                       Default, `"abs"`.
#'                       If `distance.local = "abs"` lphom_local selects in its second step the matrix
#'                       closer to the temporary global solution under L_1 norm, among the first step compatible matrices.
#'                       If `distance.local = "max"` lphom_local selects in its second step the matrix
#'                       closer to the temporary global solution under L_Inf norm, among the first step compatible matrices.
#'                       If `distance.local = "none"`, the second step of lphom_local is not performed.
#'
#' @param verbose A `TRUE/FALSE` value that indicates if a summary of the results of the computations performed 
#'                to estimate net entries and exits should be printed on the screen. Default, `TRUE`.
#'
#' @param solver A character string indicating the linear programming solver to be used, only
#'               `lp_solve` and `symphony` are allowed. By default, `lp_solve`. The package `Rsymphony`
#'               needs to be installed for the option `symphony` to be used.  
#'
#' @param integers.solver A character string indicating the linear programming solver to be used to approximate
#'                        to the closest integer solution, only `symphony` and `lp_solve` are allowed.
#'                        By default, `symphony`. The package `Rsymphony` needs to be installed for the option `symphony` 
#'                        to be used. Only used when `integers = TRUE`. 
#'                        
#' @param burnin Number of initial solutions to be discarded before determining the final solution. By default, 0.
#'
#' @param tol Maximum deviation allowed between two consecutive iterations. The process ends when the maximum
#'            variation between two proportions for the estimation of the transfer matrix between two consecutive
#'            iterations is less than `tol` or the maximum number of iterations, `iter.max`, has been reached. By default, 0.00001.
#'
#' @param ... Other arguments to be passed to the function. Not currently used.

#'
#' @details Description of the `new_and_exit_voters` argument in more detail.
#' \itemize{
#'   \item `raw`: The default value. This argument accounts for the most plausible scenario when
#'                 estimating vote transfer matrices. A scenario with two elections elapsed at least
#'                 some months where only the raw election data recorded in the I (territorial) units,
#'                 in which the electoral space under study is divided, are available.
#'                 In this scenario, net exits and net entries are estimated according to
#'                 equation (7) of Romero et al. (2020). When both net entries and exits are no
#'                 null, constraint (15) of Pavia (2023) applies. If there are net exits and `uniform = TRUE`
#'                 either constraints (6) or (8) and (15) of Pavia (2023) are imposed. In this scenario,
#'                 J could be equal to J1 or J1 + 1 and K equal to K2 or K2 + 1.
#'  \item `regular`: This value accounts for a scenario with
#'                 two elections elapsed at least some months where (i) the column J1
#'                 of `votes_election1` corresponds to new young electors who have the right
#'                 to vote for the first time, (ii) net exits and maybe other additional
#'                 net entries are computed according to equation (7) of Romero et al. (2020), and
#'                 (iii) we can (or not) assume that net exits impact equally all the first J1 - 1
#'                 options of election 1. When both net entries and exits are no null, constraints
#'                 (13) and (15) of Pavia (2023) apply. If `uniform = TRUE` and there are net exits either
#'                 constraints (8) or (11) of Pavia (2023), depending on whether there are or not net
#'                 entries, are also imposed. In this scenario, J could be equal to J1 or J1 + 1 and
#'                 K equal to K2 or K2 + 1. Note that this scenario could be also used if
#'                 column J1 of `votes_election1` would correspond to immigrants instead of 
#'                 new young electors.
#'  \item `ordinary`: This value accounts for a scenario
#'                 with two elections elapsed at least some months where (i) the column K1
#'                 of `votes_election2` corresponds to electors who died in the period between
#'                 elections, (ii) net entries and maybe other additional net exits are
#'                 computed according to equation (7) of Romero et al. (2020), and (iii) we can
#'                 assume (or not) that exits impact equally all the J1 options of election 1.
#'                 When both net entries and exits are no null, constraints (14) and
#'                 (15) of Pavia (2023) apply and if `uniform = TRUE` either constraints
#'                 (8) and (9) or, without net entries, (6) and (7) of Pavia (2023) are also imposed.
#'                 In this scenario, J could be equal to J1 or J1 + 1 and K equal to K2 or K2 + 1.
#'                 Note that this scenario could be also used if column K1 of 
#'                 `votes_election2` would correspond to emigrants instead of deaths.
#'  \item `enriched`: This value accounts for a scenario that somehow combine `regular` and
#'                 `ordinary` scenarios. We consider two elections elapsed at least some months where
#'                 (i) the column J1 of `votes_election1` corresponds to new young electors
#'                  who have the right to vote for the first time, (ii) the column K2 of
#'                 `votes_election2` corresponds to electors who died in the interperiod
#'                 election, (iii) other (net) entries and (net) exits are computed according
#'                 to equation (7) of Romero et al. (2020), and (iv) we can assume
#'                 (or not) that exits impact equally all the J1 - 1 options of election 1.
#'                 When both net entries and exits are no null, constraints (12) to
#'                 (15) of Pavia (2023) apply and if `uniform = TRUE` constraints
#'                 (10) and (11) of Pavia (2023) are also imposed. In this scenario, J could be equal
#'                 to J1 or J1 + 1 and K equal to K2 or K2 + 1. Note that this scenario could be also used if
#'                 the column J1 of `votes_election1` would correspond to immigrants instead of 
#'                 new young electors and/or if column K1 of `votes_election2` would correspond
#'                 to emigrants instead of deaths.
#'  \item `adjust1`: This value accounts for a scenario
#'                 with two elections elapsed at least some months where the census in 
#'                 each of the I polling units of the first election (the row-sums of `votes_election1`) are 
#'                 proportionally adjusted to match the corresponding census of the polling units in the 
#'                 second election (the row-sums of `votes_election2`).
#'                 If `integers = TRUE`, each row in `votes_election1` is proportionally adjusted to the closest integer
#'                 vector whose sum is equal to the sum of the corresponding row in `votes_election2`.
#'  \item `adjust2`: This value accounts for a scenario
#'                 with two elections elapsed at least some months where the census in 
#'                 each of the I polling units of the second election (the row-sums of `votes_election2`) 
#'                 are proportionally adjusted to match the corresponding census of the polling units 
#'                 in the first election (the row-sums of `votes_election1`).
#'                 If `integers = TRUE`, each row in `votes_election2` is adjusted to the closest integer
#'                 vector whose sum is equal to the sum of the corresponding row in `votes_election1`.
#'  \item `simultaneous`: This is the value to be used in classical ecological inference problems,
#'                such as in ecological studies of racial voting, and in scenarios with two simultaneous elections.
#'                In this scenario, the sum by rows of `votes_election1` and `votes_election2` must coincide.
#'                Constraints defined by equations (8) and (9) of Romero et al. (2020) are not included in
#'                the model. In this case, the lphom function just implements the basic model defined,
#'                for instance, by equations (1) to (5) of Pavia (2024).
#'  \item `semifull`: This value accounts for a scenario with two elections elapsed at least some
#'                months, where: (i) the column J1 = J of `votes_election1` totals new
#'                electors (young and immigrants) that have the right to vote for the first time and
#'                (ii) the column K2 = K of `votes_election2` corresponds to total exits of the census
#'                lists (due to death or emigration). In this scenario, the sum by rows of
#'                `votes_election1` and `votes_election2` must agree and constraint (15)
#'                of Pavia (2023) apply. Additionally, if `uniform = TRUE` constraints
#'                (8) of Pavia (2023) are also imposed.
#'  \item `full`: This value accounts for a scenario with two elections elapsed at least some
#'                months, where (i) the column J - 1 of `votes_election1` totals new young
#'                electors that have the right to vote for the first time, (ii) the column J (=J1)
#'                of `votes_election1` measures new immigrants that have the right to vote and
#'                (iii) the column K (=K2) of `votes_election2` corresponds to total exits of the census
#'                lists (due to death or emigration). In this scenario, the sum by rows of
#'                `votes_election1` and `votes_election2` must agree and constraints (13)
#'                and (15) of Pavia (2023) apply.  Additionally, if `uniform = TRUE` constraints
#'                (11) of Pavia (2023) are also imposed.
#'  \item `fullreverse`: This value is somehow the mirror version of `full`. 
#'                It accounts for a scenario with two elections elapsed at least some
#'                months, where (i) the column J1 = J of `votes_election1` totals new
#'                electors (young and immigrants) that have the right to vote for the first time and
#'                (ii) where total exits are separated out between exits due to emigration 
#'                (column K - 1 of `votes_election2`) and death (column K of `votes_election2`). 
#'               In this scenario, the sum by rows of `votes_election1` and `votes_election2` must 
#'               agree and constraints (14) and (15) of Pavia (2023) apply. 
#'                Additionally, if `uniform = TRUE` constraints (8) and (9) of Pavia (2023) are also imposed.
#'  \item `gold`: This value accounts for a scenario similar to `full`, where total exits are
#'               separated out between exits due to emigration (column K - 1 of `votes_election2`)
#'               and death (column K of `votes_election2`). In this scenario, the sum by rows
#'               of `votes_election1` and `votes_election2` must agree. Constraints (12) to
#'               (15) of Pavia (2023) apply and if `uniform = TRUE` constraints (10) and (11)
#'               of Pavia (2023) are also imposed.
