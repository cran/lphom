\title{Implements the nslphom_dual algorithm}
\usage{
nslphom_dual(
  votes_election1,
  votes_election2,
  iter.max = 10,
  min.first = FALSE,
  counts = FALSE,
  solver = "lp_solve",
  tol = 10^-5
)
}
\arguments{
\item{votes_election1}{data.frame (or matrix) of order IxJ with the votes gained by the \emph{J}
political options competing on election 1 (or origin) in the \emph{I}
territorial units considered. In general, the counts to be initially
mapped to columns. The sum by rows of \code{votes_election1} and
\code{votes_election2} must coincide.}

\item{votes_election2}{data.frame (or matrix) of order IxK with the votes gained by
the \emph{K} political options competing on election 2 (or destination)
in the \emph{I} territorial units considered. In general, the counts to be
initially mapped to columns. The sum by rows of \code{votes_election1} and
\code{votes_election2} must coincide.}

\item{iter.max}{Maximum number of iterations to be performed in each dual linear program.
The process ends independently in each system when either the number of iterations reaches
iter.max or when the maximum variation between two consecutive estimates of the
probability transfer matrix is less than \code{tol}. By default, 10.}

\item{min.first}{A TRUE/FALSE value. If FALSE, the matrix associated with the minimum \code{HETe} after
performing \code{iter.max} iterations is taken as solution.
If TRUE, the associated matrix to the instant in which the first decrease of \code{HETe} occurs
is taken as solution. The process stops at that moment. In this last scenario
(when \code{min.first = TRUE}), \code{iter.max} is is forced to be at least 100. Default, FALSE.}

\item{counts}{A TRUE/FALSE value that indicates whether the problem is solved in integer values (counts) in
each iteration: zero (lphom) and intermediate and final (including unit) solutions.
If TRUE, the initial LP matrices are approximated in each iteration to the closest integer solution
solving the corresponding Integer Linear Program. Default, FALSE.}

\item{solver}{A character string indicating the linear programming solver to be used, only
\code{lp_solve} and \code{symphony} are allowed. By default, \code{lp_solve}.}

\item{tol}{Maximum deviation allowed between two consecutive iterations. The process ends when the maximum
variation between two proportions for the estimation of the transfer matrix between two consecutive
iterations is less than \code{tol} or the maximum number of iterations has been reached. By default, 0.00001.}
}
